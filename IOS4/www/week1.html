						What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?
					</h5>
					<p>
						I would be able to implement geolocation, accelerometer, compass, camera.

					<h5> 
						What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?
					</h5>
					<p>
						Since my application is a emergency evacuation shopping list to prepare for emergency's like hurricanes, tornados and such. I think that the extra features would make the application better.
						Geolocation so that the user can access their location as well as emergency services.
						Accelerometer can detect changes in motion and positions.
						Compass so that the user can tell what direction that they are going or needs to go.
						Camera so that the user can take pictures to show where they are at if the other features fail to work.

					<h5> 
						Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.
					</h5>
					<p>
						Since my application is fully functional already, I just need to add the extrafeatures mentioned above in question 2.

					<h5> 
						Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
					</h5>
					<p>
						I have learned that there are so many ways to do one thing when it comes to design, development, by doing alot of research. With that being said, I have also learned that even though there are so many ways to do one thing......there are reasons why one is better than the other and the key is to know why.
						I also learned not to spend so much time trying to figure how one line of code does the same thing as 4 lines of code. This has caused me to lose many hours of getting a project done in a reasonable amount of time.
