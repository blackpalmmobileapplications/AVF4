						What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?
					</h5>
					<p>
						I should consider how I code to make my application work better with different browsers and devices and make my pages display better as well as easier to understand by properly labeling my anchor tags. Also seperate my content from my visual content, and also my active conetent and scripts. Add alternative text to my pictures so that the reader will give the user an understanding of the piture being scrolled over.

						Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
					</h5>
					<p>
					    Vig-link type words (words that are linked), anchor tags /tags not properly labeled, forms not properly labeled, missing alt attributes.
                        Fix to some of these problems? Make sure that the links are related to the topic being read/listened to.   Make sure that the anchor tags are properly tagged as well as the forms having the correct label.

						Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.
					</h5>
					<p>
						Nuance TALKS: They offer technology that gives users audio for their ontacts, call identifications, text messaging, web browsing, supprots over 20 languages. The minus is that it only works with Symbian phones.
						Qualcomm has an eyes free cell phone that allows users to have access to  a handful of simple finger movements that can be started at any point on the handset's touch screen. Voice prompts and vibration provide feedback to users, and the UI adapts to usage patterns and preferences.

						Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.
					</h5>
					<p>
						Blind Tunes for ios script allows you to select multiple files and click them to add to another playlist or create new playlists from selection. It also allows the user the ability to drag and drop multiple tracks across multiple rows of tracks. The window automatically scrolls for you. You can check and uncheck items as well for customizing playlists for burning to disc or manually managing your library that syncs with an iPod.
                        More features include sorting the column headers of a music library or playlist. You can even reArrange the columns to a specific order. Helpful messages tell you if the column browser is enabled and if so, when hitting enter in the sources area, will take you to the columns if you have them enabled.
